# Connect-Four-
Connect Four Python application created in CS111 that allows the user to either play against an AI Opponent with varying difficulties or
against another user. 


## What I Learned
* Object-oriented programming in Python
* Using algorithm to design an AI player that looks x moves ahead

## How to Play
* Run the ps9pr4.py to start. 
* If you want to play against another user, enter the commnad: connect_four(Player('X'), Player('O'))
* If you want to play against an AI opponent, enter the command: connect_four(Player('X'), AIPlayer('O', 'RANDOM', 1))
    * The user can control the difficulty of the AI player by increasing the third parameter of the AIPlayer to a larger integer. 
      The larger the value entered, the more moves the AI player is able to look ahead.
