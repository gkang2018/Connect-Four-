I agree with the authors on the conference paper that point out the benefits for the
medical and legal fields. Pivot searching becomes a method that aids in efficiency
of searches for professionals. This is because no longer are they tasked with
tediously sifting through data but instead can quickly access such information. I believe the implications for pivot searching can
also stretch to businesses when they are provided with extensive documents of data and
need a more time-effective way of interpreting individual data bits. The only concern
is the one that was mentioned in the article: privacy. How can these creators
ensure that once an individual's data is imported, it's not at risk of being
manipulated. In a world that yearns for my technological innovation, we have to create
methods to protect our personal information.
